            <h2>Rolls-Royce Vehicle Locator</h2>
            
			<p>During my time at Connect-Auto, I helped run the design phase on a project for Rolls-Royce - to create a pre-owned vehicle locator lookup site. Customers should be able to easily locate and browse the available pre-owned Rolls-Royce alongside comprehensive information about each vehicle, including its model, year, mileage, and condition. I worked with another designer on this project, before taking over as the lead towards delivery and for further support required after.</p>
            
            <p>There were several goals we aimed to achieve: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>To boost sales through dealer networks. It was common for customers to purchase used vehicles through third-party websites, cutting RRMC out from the sale.</li>
                <li>Encourage a returning user base and build brand loyalty.</li>
                <li>Give the decision making power back to the customer. Negotiations with a dealers can often be uncomfortable or daunting and utlimately lose customer trust. </li>
                <li>Achieve dealer acceptance. With less control, find ways to support the dealer network through this change. </li>
                <li>A mobile first experience.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>With these goals in mind, we were able to start the discovery phase.</p>

            <h3>Understanding the customer</h3>
            
            <p>From user workshops with the client, we set out to understand the type of customers that Rolls-Royce would target with their pre-owned locator. We were able to identify three customers:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>This customer is driven by in-depth technical information is best converted by displaying information in an easy to digest format, with explanatory videos, imagery and diagrams. The ability to then compare against other models or even the competition helps them to make their mind up more quickly. </li>
            
                <li>A customer that is passionate about the brand but is not confident on its affordability can be taken through the site with a focus on monthly payments, strong residual values, low cost of ownership and a hassle-free purchase experience to provide the necessary peace of mind. </li>
            
                <li>Existing customers already understand the Rolls-Royce ethos so allowing them to see the differences between their existing car and the one on their shortlist helps to generate the perceived value in the new car, and removes the financial barrier to purchase.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>From here we were able to come up with some key points to focus on.</p>
            
            <a href="images/rolls-royce/rolls-royce-3.png" data-lightbox="image-set" data-title="Rolls-Royce Interior">

            <h3>Vehicle search results</h3>
            
            <p>Design features: It was important that the customer could see at a glance what made each vehicle unique. In the absence of financing info, the vehicle tiles had space to display these key features. </p>
            
            <p>Shortlist & compare: Encourages returning users, these features would save for each session. </p>

			</a>
            
            <h3>Vehicle details page</h3>
            
            <p>Image carousel: Images on VDPs are proven to be the most engaged with feature (RRMC - 60% of all recorded clicks are on the image carousel). Their size & prominence on the page reflects this.</p>
            
            <p>Provenance anchor: “Why provenance?” scrolls the user to the foot of the page to read up about the benefits of choosing to buy with Rolls-Royce. This could help mitigate some of the loss of sales within dealer networks, by keeping this tag front and centre at the top of the page. </p>

			</a>
            
            <h3>Model select page</h3>
            
            <p>A difficult challenge to overcome was the requirement to get the the users location before displaying vehicles. An inline field, directly next to the search button, was chosen to see if it would prevent users from dropping off..</p>
            
            <p>After running this we found that nearly 80% of users feel comfortable entering their location, and make it to the next page. This could probably be improved on- but with privacy sensitive users, it will always be a challenge.</p>

            <h3>Design system</h3>
            
            <p>Approved Vehicle Locators, as a platform, had been integral to Connect-Auto's offering for some time. For this reason, a lot of development work was achieved using a custom built CMS with prebuilt templates. Due to this, every module and template included restraints. A design challenge was in making RRMC feel bespoke despite these constraints.</p>

            <h3>Findings and results</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Returning visitors at around 20%, a reasonable result to suggest brand loyalty.</li>
                <li>Dealer acceptance has been good. Response from RRMC has been positive and has led to dealers noticing improvements to be made and forwarding these requests on.</li>
                <li>Transactions were not as successful. Enquiry forms show a very low conversion rate and was something marked to be improved on for the next major release.</li>
            </ol>
